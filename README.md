# ALIA
Prolog project where we aim to simulate the game Connect 4 (Puissance 4), with two competing AIs playing the game.

--
#TODO
+ Handle display of the board
+ Handle gameover state
+ Implement the AI predicate

*Tip for the AI*: Start w/ a dummy algorithm (random) to try out the game's mechanics.
